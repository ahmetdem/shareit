### Server Component:

1.  **Setup Server Socket**: Create a TCP server socket that listens for incoming connections from clients.
2.  **Accept Connections**: Accept incoming client connections and handle each connection in a separate thread or process.
3.  **Receive File**: Implement functionality to receive file data from the client over the established socket connection.
4.  **Save File**: Write the received file data to a file on the server's filesystem.
5.  **Close Connection**: Close the socket connection with the client after the file transfer is complete.
6.  **Repeat**: Continue listening for new client connections and handling file transfers as needed.

### Client Component:

1.  **Setup Client Socket**: Create a TCP client socket and connect to the server's IP address and port number.
2.  **Read File**: Open the file you want to transfer from the client's filesystem.
3.  **Send File**: Read the file data in chunks and send it to the server over the socket connection.
4.  **Close Connection**: Close the socket connection with the server after the file transfer is complete.
5.  **Repeat**: If necessary, repeat the file transfer process for additional files or with different servers.

### Testing:

1.  **Run Server**: Start the server component on your local machine, specifying the port number it will listen on for incoming connections.
2.  **Run Client**: Start the client component on your local machine, specifying the server's IP address and port number.
3.  **Initiate File Transfer**: From the client, initiate the file transfer process by sending the file to the server.
4.  **Verify Transfer**: Verify that the server receives the file data correctly and saves it to the specified location on the filesystem.
5.  **Repeat Testing**: If necessary, repeat the testing process with different files or configurations to ensure the file transfer functionality works as expected.
